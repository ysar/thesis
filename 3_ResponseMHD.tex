\section{Introduction}
The gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, both possess a strong internal magnetic field like Earth, but the relatively fast planetary rotation and the presence of significant internal sources of plasma lead to vastly different magnetospheric configurations and dynamics compared to the terrestrial magnetosphere \cite{Khurana2004a,Krupp2004DynamicsMagnetosphere}. The internal sources of plasma at the giant planets are supplied predominantly by their moons, Io at Jupiter \cite{Bolton2015a} and Enceladus at Saturn \cite{Blanc2015}. In particular at Jupiter, through ionization of its volcanically erupted neutral particles, Io supplies heavy ions at a rate of $\sim$250–1,000 kg/s to the magnetosphere \cite{Bagenal2011b}. This leads to a high‐density plasma sheet that is forced to corotate with the planet to large radial extents ($\sim$20–30 $R_J$) by the corotation enforcement current system composed of radial currents in the equatorial plane, field‐aligned currents that couple the magnetosphere to the ionosphere and Pedersen currents in the ionosphere \cite{Cowley2003a,Cowley2001a,Hill1979,Hill1980,Hill2001,Vasyliunas1983a}. In studying the complex spatial form and temporal variability of Jovian aurora, it is typically subdivided into three components—main emission (oval), polar emissions, and equatorward emissions. The main oval of the Jovian aurora is thought to be at the location in the ionosphere where upward field‐aligned currents associated with the corotation enforcement current system are present \cite{Cowley2001a,Hill2001,Southwood2001a}. Theoretical models have predicted that a compression of the magnetosphere due to an increase in solar wind dynamic pressure would lead to a reduction of the main auroral oval intensity on the dayside \cite{Cowley2003a,Cowley2007,Southwood2001a}. Subcorotating plasma in the dayside equatorial magnetosphere would speed up in the azimuthal direction as the magnetosphere is compressed due to conservation of angular momentum, thereby decreasing the strength of the corotation enforcement current at this location, which in turn would dim the Jovian main aurora. Using a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, \citeA{Chane2017a} found that while the nightside/flank currents in the ionosphere are enhanced due to a simulated forward shock, the dayside currents are weakened, which is consistent with the previous theoretical prediction. 

Although the Jovian ultraviolet (UV) aurora is well structured and always present, remote observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Hisaki/EXCEED observations of the Jovian UV aurora have also shown that its intensity is highly variable and is often correlated with the dynamic pressure of the upstream solar wind \cite{Clarke2009,Kimura2015,Kimura2018,Kita2016,Nichols2007a,Nichols2017a}. Due to lack of a dedicated solar wind monitor at Jupiter, identifying the correlation between changes in the auroral emissions and upstream parameters typically requires a numerical model, typically a 1‐D MHD model \cite{Tao2005,Zieger2008}, to propagate the solar wind from 1 AU to Jupiter's orbit, which is subject to timing errors due to assumptions made in the model and the orbital geometry/alignment of Jupiter relative to available solar wind monitors at 1 AU. Exceptions to this situation include Cassini's flyby of Jupiter and Juno's approach orbit, during which in situ measurements of the solar wind and remote observations of the Jovian aurora could be made simultaneously \cite{Gurnett2002a,Nichols2007a,Nichols2017a}. \citeA{Gurnett2002a} report an event where Cassini observed an interplanetary shock a few hours prior to a large increase in UV emission intensity from Jupiter. Recently, \cite{Nichols2017a} report observations made by HST during Juno's approach to Jupiter, during which the Juno spacecraft detected a large increase in solar wind dynamic pressure \cite{Wilson2018}, which resulted in intensification of the main emission in UV, observed by both HST and the Hisaki spacecraft \cite{Kimura2017}.

Intensities of the polar emissions are comparable to those of the main emission \cite{Grodent2003a}; however, unlike the main emission, they do not have a steady morphology and are highly variable. UV observations made by HST have shown that the polar aurora contains highly dynamic regions with different repeating patterns such as “swirls” (in the swirl‐region), “arcs,” and “patches” (in the dusk active region) and occasional “filaments” \cite{Bonfond2017,Grodent2015,Grodent2003a,Nichols2009a}. Due to the complex rotationally driven dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere \cite{Vasyliunas1983a}, it is unclear how much open flux is typically present in the Jovian polar regions, and which features of the polar aurorae map to open field lines in the solar wind as opposed to processes in the outer magnetosphere or magnetotail \cite{Cowley2003a}. Some models argue that Jupiter's magnetosphere is largely closed \cite{McComas2007}, since the reconnected field lines may undergo successive reconnection during the time it takes to travel through the magnetosphere, while other studies predict that Jupiter's magnetosphere does contain appreciable amount of open flux \cite{Cowley2008,Masters2017,Vogt2011a} and that the Dungey cycle \cite{Dungey1961b} and the Vasyliunas cycle coexist to influence the structure and dynamics of Jupiter's magnetosphere. 

Using the MHD model (Chapter 2), we investigate in detail the time‐dependent global response of the Jovian magnetosphere to different types of solar wind disturbances, such as interplanetary shocks and the rotation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We analyze the response of the corotation enforcement current system to these upstream changes, to ultimately understand how the Jovian UV aurora responds to changes in the upstream solar wind.

\section{Methodology}

After creating the quasi‐steady state magnetosphere using a purely southward IMF, we continue the simulation in time‐accurate mode and perform four simulation runs using the following sets of upstream input (Table \ref{tab:sw-conditions}). 

\begin{table}

    \caption{The solar wind and IMF properties used in this study. The solar wind flows in the $-X$ direction. The last row highlights the solar wind dynamic pressure. For Runs 3 and 4, the IMF is oriented toward the $Y$ direction, which is typical for Jupiter's orbit.}
    \label{tab:sw-conditions}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Run 1: No change—continued run with fixed southward $B_Z$ and steady solar wind
    \item Run 2: Introduce a dynamic pressure enhancement (forward shock) under southward IMF
    \item Run 3: Turn the IMF from a purely southward ($B_Z$) to Parker‐spiral like ($B_Y > 0$).
    \item Run 4: Introduce a dynamic pressure enhancement (forward shock) under Parker spiral IMF
\end{itemize}

Two configurations of the magnetosphere were first created: Run 1 for a closed magnetosphere a parallel/southward IMF and Run 3 for an open magnetosphere with a Parker spiral IMF. After the completion of Runs 1 and 3, upstream solar wind conditions were changed to simulate a dynamic pressure enhancement similar to that expected for an interplanetary forward shock (Runs 2 and 4). Solar wind plasma properties and magnetic field magnitude between Runs 1 and 3 were kept the same, that is, same mass density, velocity, and thus dynamic pressure. Likewise, the plasma properties and magnetic field magnitude of the shocked solar wind in Runs 2 and 4 were kept the same, with the only difference being the IMF clock angle. We designed these simulations specifically for understanding the influence of the solar wind dynamic pressure enhancement on Jupiter's magnetosphere under two different states: a closed magnetosphere with minimal impact from dayside reconnection and an open magnetosphere with dayside reconnection expected between the Parker spiral like IMF and the magnetospheric field.

\subsection{Calculating the net ionospheric current}
The ionospheric Ohm's law solver used in our model uses a spherical grid discretized at specific intervals in latitude and local time where each point can be identified by the indices $j$ and $i$ respectively. For a given simulation time $n$, we first calculate the net outward current (units of amperes) for a particular local time bin $i$ as,

\begin{equation}
    I_1^n \left(\phi\right)_i \approx \sum_{j=1}^{N_\theta} \left( \frac{|J_R| + J_R }{2} \right)_{i,j} \Delta s_{i,j}
\end{equation}

In this equation $J_{R_{i,j}}$ the radial current density at location $(i,j)$ and $\Delta s_{i,j}$ is the area of the spherical rectangle formed by the points $(i+1/2,j)$, $(i-1/2,j)$, $(i,j+1/2)$, and $(i,j-1/2)$. This parameter $I_1$ is plotted as a function of local time in column 2 of Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}. Each thin line represents the nth time of the simulation with a spacing of 0.5 hr. Thick blue or red lines represent the average value of I1 at a particular local time before and after changing the upstream conditions, respectively. As can be seen in column 2, the parameter $I_1$ is useful for revealing the local time‐dependent response of the outward currents, which are thought to be related to the emission intensity of Jupiter's main auroral oval. We then sum $I_1$ over all local times to obtain the net outward current (units of amperes) in one hemisphere at a particular time $n$ as - 

\begin{equation}
    I_{net}^n = \sum_i^{N_\phi} I_1^n(\phi)_i
\end{equation}

Here $N_\phi$ and $N_\theta$ are the number of grid cells in the azimuthal and meridional directions, respectively. In our simulations $N_\phi$ = 361 and $N_\theta$ = 181 for each hemisphere. The quantity $I_{net}$ represents the net outward current from one hemisphere and is plotted as a function of simulation time in Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}, column 3. The red vertical dashed line represents the time when the upstream perturbation reaches the subsolar bow shock. Blue curves in column 3 represent the trend expected if there was no change in upstream conditions (same the blue curve in Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐1c).

\section{Results: Magnetospheric response}

The right column shows the plasma density contours in the equatorial (XY) plane. The magneta dots are the identified equatorial crossings of the last closed field lines.}
    \label{fig:mhd-solarwind-upstream}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:mhd-solarwind-upstream} we show the response of the magnetosphere from these four runs. Plotted in the left and right columns are contours of plasma mass density (log scale) in the meridional plane and equatorial plane, respectively, along with the equatorial footprints of the last closed field lines in a similar format as used for Figure 3. In the meridional ($Y = 0$) plane, we also superimpose magnetic field lines in white that illustrate the disk‐like configuration in the inner and middle magnetosphere, which is indicative of the presence of a strong current sheet and departure of the magnetospheric field from dipolar configuration, which is qualitatively consistent with in situ magnetic field measurements \cite{Khurana2001}.

\subsection{Magnetospheric response to IMF rotation (Run 3: From southward \texorpdfstring{$B_Z$}{Bz} to spiral IMF with \texorpdfstring{$B_Y > 0$}{By>0}) }

When the IMF is turned from parallel to a spiral configuration, the magnetic shear across the dayside magnetopause increases such that magnetic reconnection occurs at the dayside magnetopause in the simulation resulting in the twisted dayside magnetic field lines as shown Figure \ref{fig:mhd-solarwind-upstream}, row 3. On the nightside, the equatorial footprints of the last closed field lines provide a good proxy for the reconnection X‐line, and we find that after turning the IMF to the Parker‐spiral configuration, the tail X‐line moves planetward. The tail X‐line location also exhibits a dawn‐dusk asymmetry, being located further from the planet on the duskside and closer to the planet on the dawnside, consistent with that inferred from observations \cite{Vogt2010a,Vogt2014,Woch2002a}. In addition to the planetward shift of the tail X‐line, turning the IMF also adds open magnetic flux to the magnetotail lobes, which can also be seen in later plots (Figure \ref{fig:mhd-solarwind-upstream}) where we show the open flux in the ionosphere, and the consequence of the addition of open field lines will be discussed in later sections. As open field lines are added to the tail lobes, the tail magnetic field becomes more stretched with a strong $B_X$ component, in contrast to the dipolar configuration under parallel IMF conditions (Run 1 as shown in row 1 of Figure \ref{fig:mhd-solarwind-upstream}). 

\subsection{Magnetospheric response to dynamic pressure enhancement (Runs 2 and 4)}

The forward shock introduced in Runs 2 and 4 corresponds to a dynamic pressure enhancement of a factor of $\sim$5 (from 0.053 to 0.258 nPa) with the plasma properties upstream and downstream of the shock taken such that the Rankine‐Hugoniot shock relations are satisfied. For Run 2 where the IMF is maintained in the parallel orientation that results in a closed magnetosphere, compression by the introduced forward shock causes the bow shock to move from $\sim$80 to $\sim$60 $R_J$ at the subsolar point, whereas the subsolar magnetopause moves from $\sim$60 to $\sim$40 $R_J$. In the case of an open magnetosphere (Run 4 where the IMF is in the spiral configuration), the bow shock moves from $\sim$75 to $\sim$50 $R_J$, whereas the magnetopause moves planetward from $\sim$50 to $\sim$40 $R_J$ at the subsolar point in response to the shock of the same magnitude as in Run 2. The compression due to the forward shock shrinks the magnetosphere in all directions, including the lobes and magnetospheric flanks. In both cases of the closed and open magnetosphere, the last closed field lines move planetward on the nightside. Run 4 shows the location of the X‐line for the shocked Parker‐spiral IMF, and it lies between 50 and 70 $R_J$ near midnight. Near the magnetopause flanks, the last closed field lines lie at a distance of ~$100$ $R_J$ from the planet. This creates a peculiar configuration of the magnetotail where the closed field lines extend to larger distances on the flanks than in the midnight sector, similar to that predicted for Saturn by \cite{Jia2012}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images3/combined_corotation_change.png}
    \caption{Contours of $\Omega_z/\Omega_\text{Jupiter}$ in the equatorial and meridional plane for Run 2 during a solar wind driven compression of the magnetosphere. The rightmost column shows the corresponding current density in the ionosphere.}
    \label{fig:combined-corotation-change}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:combined-corotation-change}, we show the contours of plasma angular velocity about the $Z$ axis in the meridional and equatorial plane at different times corresponding to Run 2. The angular velocity is normalized to that of the planet, i.e. $\Omega/\Omega_J=1$ imply that the plasma is fully corotating with the planet. Also shown are the contours of current density in the ionosphere at the corresponding times. Under steady solar wind conditions, the plasma in the inner and middle magnetosphere is seen to corotate with planet until 20 to 30 $R_J$, when it starts to lag the planetary rotation. This behaviour is seen throughout the field lines mapping these radial locations. The polar regions of the planet however, do not show any preference for corotation.

After a forward shock is introduced in the solar wind, the profiles of corotation velocity are perturbed. Initially, within a $\sim$5 hour period, the shock shrinks the corotating region on the dayside. After $\sim10$ hours, after the passage of the shock, the angular velocity at the dayside outer magnetosphere increases, and regions which were previously sub-corotating are now seen to fully corotate. This transient increase in plasma angular velocity on the dayside subsides after additional time has passed. Correspondingly, as the magnetosphere is compressed, the current density in the ionosphere decreases on the dayside. The reduction in currents is not immediate, but occurs after a delay corresponding to the time when the strongly corotating region forms behind the dayside magnetopause. Both features in the magnetosphere and ionosphere are seen at $\sim10$ LT, as the field exhibits the least bend-back at these locations. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images3/combined_corotation_change_2.png}
    \caption{Contours of $\Omega_z/\Omega_\text{Jupiter}$ in the equatorial and meridional plane for Run 4 during a solar wind driven compression of the magnetosphere. The rightmost column shows the corresponding current density in the ionosphere.}
    \label{fig:combined-corotation-change-2}
\end{figure}

A similar behaviour was seen during Run 4, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:combined-corotation-change-2}. In this case as well, the corotation velocity of the plasma was seen to increase after the solar wind driven compression. However, unlike in the previous case, a large solar wind dynamic pressure causes reconnection to occur in the magnetotail, which generates faster return flows which increase the corotation velocity at the edges of the corotating region at around 03-05 local time. As in the case of Run 2, the response to the ionosphere and magnetosphere is seen several hours after the passage of the shock.

\section{Results: Ionospheric response}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images3/ionosphere-currents.jpg}
    \caption{Ionospheric response. Each row represents the ionospheric response to the four runs. The first column shows contours of radial current density at the ionosphere with positive values representing outward current. Yellow points are the extracted footprints at the open‐closed field line boundaries. In column 2 we show the latitude integrated outward current in the ionosphere as a function of local time. Each curve represents an instance in our simulation, with blue lines representing times before the upstream perturbation reaches the bow shock and red lines representing times after. In column 3 we show the total integrated outward current for all latitudes and local times as a function of simulation time. The blue curves in column 3 represent the variation of total outward current as a function of time for the closed magnetosphere under steady upstream conditions. The red curves represent the same quantity for the particular test case.}
    \label{fig:ionosphere-currents}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents} shows the response of the ionosphere to changes in the different upstream conditions. The left column presents snapshots from each run showing the contours of the current density parallel to the magnetic field ($J_\parallel$). For the northern hemisphere shown here, positive values indicate outward currents and negative values indicate inward currents. The main feature of the current distribution is the circumpolar ring of outward currents centered at $\sim75^\circ$ latitude. Inside of (or poleward of) the ring are downward field‐aligned currents. The upward and downward currents are connected through the horizontal Pedersen currents in the ionosphere, and these currents together make up the corotation enforcement current system. 

\subsection{Ionospheric response - Run 1 (Fixed upstream with parallel IMF)}

For the $\sim$400‐hr duration of Run 1 (Figures \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐1a to 1c), the magnetosphere remains largely closed due to the southward $B_Z$ IMF imposed at the upstream boundary. Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐1b shows that there is a persistent day‐night asymmetry present in the field‐aligned current distribution with outward currents stronger on the nightside than on the dayside. Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐1c also shows that the net outward current is steadily increasing with time (and at all local times/longitudes), despite the upstream conditions being constant. Initially, the rate of increase of the currents is almost linear, but with time the growth rate decreases and eventually the currents are seen to decrease. We believe that the growing trend of currents (with time scales of tens of hours), in the absence of any change in external conditions, is due to internal factors. As the magnetosphere builds more mass due to mass loading in the Io plasma torus, more torque is required from the ionosphere in order to force the magnetospheric plasma to corotate with the planet. Alternatively, consistent mass loading would increase the bend back of the magnetic field lines, which would increase magnetic field strength in the high‐latitude regions thereby increasing $J_\parallel$ in the ionosphere. Hence, prolonged mass loading in the absence of mass loss mechanisms, such as plasmoid release, would require an increase in the corotation enforcement currents. Indeed, we see that the ionospheric currents decrease only when a plasmoid is released (at around $t = 350$ hr), suggesting that with the release of mass to the magnetotail, the net strength of the corotation enforcement circuit is reduced. For comparisons with other runs, the curve showing the expected trend of the total current (i.e., Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐1c) is included in all sub-figures in the last column. 

\subsection{Ionospheric response - Run 3 (Turning of the IMF to \texorpdfstring{$B_Y > 0$}{By>0}) }

In Run 3, the upstream plasma properties are kept the same as in Run 1, and a tangential discontinuity is introduced in the solar wind across which the IMF is rotated from southward to the Parker‐spiral configuration (with $B_Y$ > 0). As shown in Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐3a, reconnection at the magnetopause produces open magnetic field lines, and the open‐closed field line boundary (OCB; marked in yellow lines) starts to expand equatorward. At the time shown in this plot, which is roughly 75 hr after the IMF turning, the region of open field lines extends about a few degrees from the pole and the OCB lies at least 5$^\circ$ poleward of the main oval of outward currents. Similar to that in Run 1 (Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐1b), the outward currents in this run (Run 3) are stronger on the nightside than on the dayside (Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐3b) and a continuously increasing trend is seen for the net outward current (Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐3c). The red dashed line in Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐3c marks the time when the discontinuity reaches the subsolar bow shock, and we can see that the rate of increase of currents (shown by the red line) deviates from the curve expected if there were no change in the upstream conditions (shown in blue). Note that the only upstream change introduced in this run is the change in IMF clock angle. Therefore, the comparison between Run 1 and Run 3 indicates that a change in IMF orientation can have significant influences on the large‐scale current systems. The increasing trend of current, which now has a larger slope, eventually changes to a decreasing trend after the release of a plasmoid at $t = 270$ hr, consistent with the behavior seen in Run 1. 

\subsection{Ionospheric response - Runs 2 and 4 (Dynamic pressure enhancement)}

In comparison to an IMF rotation, the response of the ionosphere to a forward shock, that is, a dynamic pressure enhancement, in the solar wind is more dramatic. In Runs 2 and 4, we have introduced a dynamic pressure enhancement (a factor of 5 larger than the background). First, we examine Run 2—that is, dynamic pressure enhancement under a closed magnetosphere (\ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐2a to 2c). In all our simulation runs, we find the nightside currents to be stronger than the dayside, and it can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐2b that the introduction of a forward shock makes this asymmetry more pronounced; that is, the nightside currents get stronger whereas the dayside currents get weaker. Similar enhancement of the day‐night asymmetry has also been seen in the MHD model of \cite{Chane2017a}. Apart from the overall response, there are also noticeable local time‐dependent responses: Transient peaks in the outward current appear at specific local times. Our simulation predicts a minor enhancement on the nightside (10–20\% increase in total currents) and a large decrease in current on the dayside (between 10\% and 60\%). As a result, the net outward current ($I_{net}$) sharply decreases after the impingement of the shock. After 50 hours, the system recovers and an increasing trend of the net outward current is seen again. 

Our findings are consistent with previously published theoretical models 
\cite{Cowley2003a,Cowley2007,Southwood2001a}, which have predicted that a dynamic pressure enhancement, and subsequent compression of the magnetosphere, would lead to an increase in azimuthal velocity of the plasma as it conserves angular momentum. In theory, this should decrease the strength of the corotation enforcement current system on the dayside. Consistent with this prediction, we find an increase in angular velocity inside the magnetosphere on the dayside after the shock compression, which leads to much reduced outward field‐aligned currents in the dayside ionosphere. 

A similar behavior was also found for Run 4—that is, dynamic pressure enhancement with a Parker spiral IMF (\ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐4a to 4c). Due to the increase of magnetic flux reconnecting on the dayside and the release of plasmoids on the nightside (which serves to close previously opened tail lobes), we find a prominent region of open field lines in the polar region. We also find a very strong response of the ionospheric currents, with dayside currents drastically decreasing in strength (by 50–60\%), whereas the nightside currents appear almost unaffected (Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐4b). Consequently, the net outward current also decreases sharply after the dynamic pressure enhancement at $t = 310$ hours. A key difference between Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐4c and \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐1c,2c, and 3c is that the time history of the total outward current did not recover back to the increasing trend after the dynamic pressure enhancement. This may be due to very frequent plasmoid releases in the magnetosphere after the shock compression. As seen in Runs 1 and 3, a decrease in the net outward current is well correlated with times at which a plasmoid is released. It is also noteworthy that the response of the ionosphere to the forward shock was stronger in Run 4 (open magnetosphere) than in Run 2 (closed magnetosphere). Apart from the IMF orientation, there is another difference between Runs 2 and 4: the phase of the magnetosphere in the Vasyliunas cycle. While Run 4 was started 30 hr after the release of a large plasmoid, Run 2 was initiated at a time when the magnetosphere was still in the process of accumulating mass with no prior plasmoid release. It is possible that the differences in the strength of the response may be due in part to the differences in the internal state of the magnetosphere, that is, depleted versus filled magnetosphere, rather than just the orientation of the external IMF. Clearly more work is needed to conclusively separate the internal and external influences. 

\section{Discussion}

Under steady solar wind conditions, and in the absence of magnetic reconnection (Run 1), certain features were observed consistently in the magnetosphere and ionosphere, which are discussed first. Continuous mass loading due to Io increases plasma density in the inner and middle magnetosphere, which led to a more stretched magnetodisc. Simultaneously, the outward currents in the ionosphere were seen to increase at all local times. The increase in ionospheric current density was halted only after the release of a plasmoid in the magnetotail, which decreased the magnetic stresses in the magnetotail lobes. Our results suggest that the loading and unloading of magnetic flux tubes corresponding to the Vasyliunas cycle, can also modify the currents in the ionosphere, and thus the brightness of the Jovian aurora. 

Another feature seen in all simulations is the relative weakness of outward currents in the ionosphere at noon (12 LT). Observations of the Jovian aurora have shown that it is weakest between 08-13 LT, also referred to as the `discontinuity' region. This local-time asymmetry in the ionospheric-currents has also been observed in the model by \citeA{Chane2013a}, who proposed that it was due to strong plasma corotation in the dayside, where magnetic field lines have the least `bend-back', resulting in weaker currents. This is also seen in our model, for e.g. in Figure \ref{fig:combined-corotation-change}-1b, which shows that the corotation velocity near the magnetopause at $x=50$ $R_J$ is larger than at $x=-50$ $R_J$ in the magnetotail. 

Next we shall discuss the results of Run 3, where we turned the interplanetary magnetic field and introduced magnetic shear at the magnetopause. This facilitated dayside magnetic reconnection and created open flux in the polar cap. However, like before, the currents in the ionosphere continued to strengthen, supporting the previous hypothesis that the increase in ionospheric currents was due to the internal Vasyliunas cycle. The turn in the IMF created open flux in the polar cap, which was closed at the X-line located on the nightside. The return flow from the X-line interacted with the corotating plasma flow and created a vortex in the magnetosphere on the dusk-side. A similar vortex was also seen by \cite{Fukazawa2006a} in their model. The vortex was also associated with an increase in ionospheric currents near 18 LT (dusk) and was responsible for increase the rate of increase of currents in Figure \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}-3c. Eventually, the ionospheric currents are seen to decrease after a large plasmoid was released in the magnetotail.

The strongest influence to the magnetosphere and ionosphere was seen for Runs 2 and 4, when the solar wind dynamic pressure was increased abruptly in the form of a forward shock. Certain features are consistent between both runs, which differ in their magnetospheric configuration; Run 2 represents a closed magnetosphere, whereas in Run 4 the magnetosphere is open, which allows for magnetic reconnection to occur more strongly on the dayside due to strong solar wind driving. In both cases, the dynamic pressure enhancement was seen to increase the corotation velocity in the dayside, which decreased the strength of the corotation enforcement current system. However, while the largest decrease in currents was seen at 12 LT for Run 2 (closed), the corresponding reduction in Run 4 was much stronger and occurred at roughly 10 LT. In both cases, the response to the magnetosphere and ionosphere was not immediate. The increase in corotation velocity in the magnetosphere (Figure \ref{fig:combined-corotation-change}) occurred many hours after the passage of the shock. 

Our model results support the predictions made by theoretical models \cite{Cowley2003a,Cowley2007,Southwood2001a} but are contradictory to observations of the HST aurora, which have large seen a positive correlation between auroral intensity and solar wind dynamic pressure. We also note that the model of \cite{Chane2013a} also predicts a positive correlation, although they note that the model takes several Jovian rotations to reach the new state. In contrast, our results show that the ionospheric currents tend to naturally increase due to the Vasyliunas cycle, and do not increase more than this baseline even after several hours of constant high solar wind dynamic pressure. 

\section{Summary}
After creating a quasi‐steady state magnetosphere in the simulation, we introduced various types of changes in the upstream solar wind and IMF, such as an IMF rotation and a dynamic pressure enhancement under southward IMF and Parker spiral IMF conditions. We found that changing the IMF orientation from a southward (parallel) to Parker‐spiral like IMF created open flux in the magnetosphere and thereby modified the large‐scale magnetospheric configuration, but it alone had little effect on the corotation enforcement current system. However, in the cases where a forward shock is introduced in the solar wind, it had a significant impact on the global magnetosphere‐ionosphere system. In particular, all of our simulations showed that there is an apparent asymmetry in the field‐aligned current intensity in the ionosphere between the dayside and the nightside, with more intense currents on the nightside. This day‐night asymmetry is further enhanced by the compression of the magnetosphere by a forward shock. In the simulation where a shock is introduced under Parker‐spiral IMF conditions (Run 4), a region of intense field‐aligned currents is present in the afternoon local time sector (16 LT; \ref{fig:ionosphere-currents}‐4a and 4b), which magnetically maps to a region in the middle magnetosphere containing vortical plasma flows created due to the interaction between the return flow from tail reconnection with the corotating plasma. Although the ionospheric currents respond to the forward shock in both simulations (Runs 2 and 4), the magnitude of the response is significantly different. In general, when the magnetosphere contains more open flux (Run 4) due to dayside reconnection, the response of the ionosphere is stronger. It should be noted that while these two runs use the same solar wind parameters with the only difference being the IMF orientation used, the magnetospheric states prior to the shock impact are quite different, which may contribute in part to the differences seen in the simulated response. Future work is needed in order to isolate these two effects, that is, preconditioning of the magnetosphere and the influence of the IMF orientation. 

Overall, our simulations clearly show that a solar wind driven compression of the magnetosphere increases the corotation velocity of plasma on the dayside, which reduces the strength of currents in the ionosphere. These results support previous theoretical models, but contradict the observations of the Jovian aurora, which have found a positive correlation between auroral intensity and the solar wind dynamic pressure. 

In the present study we have assumed that Jupiter's internal magnetic field is an axisymmetric dipole. However, recent observations by Juno have revealed significant north‐south asymmetries in the internal magnetic field \cite{Connerney2018} due to the presence of large higher order moments. How the complex internal magnetic field influences the magnetosphere and its interaction with the ionosphere and the solar wind remains an outstanding question that needs to be addressed in future work.
